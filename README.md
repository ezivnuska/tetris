Tetris with Python

This is a functional game of Tetris that began as an attempt to help my son with a homework assignment. As he is fairly new to programming in any language, I warned him of the complexity of this project. He eventually gave up, but I was already deep into the challenge and had no choice but to continue. It has now become my first attempt at python.
